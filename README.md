## About the challenges

> The API Challenges is an application which you can use to practice API testing and automating. It is written in Java, runnable locally and has been deployed to the cloud for easy access. It contains a functional API and a set of challenges for you to work through. The API Challenges is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API. It also has a set of challenges that are tracked as you explore and test the API.

> The API Challenges API is used for managing a To-Do list. You need to authenticate to create a session in the system. This will create a unique API repository with basic test data. As you interact with the API there are a variety of challenges to complete e.g. Get all TODOs, Delete a Todo, etc.
